Employee Performance Prediction
1. Introduction
This project aims to predict employee performance using machine learning techniques. The core focus is on analyzing productivity data, engineering relevant features, training predictive models, and deploying them through a user-friendly web interface.

2. Dataset Overview
Source: garments_worker_productivity.csv

Description: The dataset contains records related to garment worker productivity, including variables such as department, bonus rate, and actual output.

3. Data Preprocessing
Missing values were identified and handled through imputation.

Categorical variables were transformed using one-hot encoding.

Feature scaling was performed using standardization techniques.

4. Model Development
Training: Performed in Employee_Prediction.ipynb using models like XGBoost and Logistic Regression.

Model storage: Trained models were saved as gwp.pkl and mcle.pkl for deployment.

Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy and F1-score were computed on validation data.

5. Results
The XGBoost model achieved an accuracy of XX% and an F1-score of XX% (replace with your actual numbers).

Feature importance analysis identified key predictors: [List top features found].

6. Deployment
A Flask web application (app.py) was developed for inference.

The user interface is provided using Flask templates.

Users can input new employee data and receive performance predictions in real time.

7. Conclusion
The project successfully delivers a pipeline for predicting employee performance.

Future work includes expanding to new datasets and improving prediction accuracy.
